Welcome to ToDo! a light weight productivity tool. ToDo was designed with siplicity in mind. To get up and runnig all you have to do is add the project to a directory on a web server that runs php. Head to index.php. Once there, you will see a layout where tasks are on the left, and the submission form is on the right. You can add tasks by first entering a task name, the description of the task, and its due date, then click submit -- it's that easy. Tasks that are set to expire today, or that have expired have their dates highlighted in red. To remove a task just click the checkbox and it's gone! Now enough reading, download the web app and try it out for yourself.
